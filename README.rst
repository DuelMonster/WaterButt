Acknowledgements
----------------
I'd like to thank the two guys responsible for inspiring me to create this client framework project:

`Rob McAuley`_:
	Without you and Rainwave_ I'd still be going through my MP3 collection looking for all my favourite tracks to stick on disc for the car. Now I can listen to the tracks, rate/fav them, while I work and then use the API to filter them out of my local collection ready for disc creation.

`William Jackson`_:
	If it wasn't for your gutter_ client framework I'd probably have been still struggling to understand all the outputted data from the Rainwave_ API. I have used gutter_ as a basis for WaterButt_.
